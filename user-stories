Rotten Cookies User Stories
============================
A tv show search application where users can search tv shows by name genre or other creteria.

The user should be greeted with a welcome message or cookie prompt upon entering the site.
If the user denies the cookies, the user should be redirected away from the page. Additionally, I expect to see a login pop-up window or an ad with a movable X close button. 
The website will display a 'cookie' rating, and when the user hovers hover over it, it should show more details.
The website should utilize local storage to save information even if I refresh the page.
The website will have a carousel that automatically scrolls after a certain time, as well as the ability to navigate left and right by clicking. 
For a personalized experience, the carousel should adapt to my most frequent actions, such as suggesting movies based on my preferences. If possible, I would like to have the option to get movie results by decade. 
The website should include a video player for trailers or ads, a shuffle button to suggest movies randomly, and a simple array-based search result feature. Additionally, a 'back to top' button should float approximately one-third down the page. 
Overall, the website should have a 'pretty' CSS design, utilize dynamic code and modules, and be linked to APIs for data retrieval. As an optional enhancement, it would be great to include authorization for better security and incorporate programming slang to find/hide within the code or page for a playful touch."
